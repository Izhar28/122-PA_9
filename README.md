Overview

This game follows the fundamental movement mechanics of standard Chess but introduces a simplified win condition and a chaotic game mode.

Core Rules

1. Movement

All pieces (Pawns, Rooks, Knights, Bishops, Queens, Kings) move according to Standard Chess Rules.

En passant, castling, and pawn promotion follow standard rules unless otherwise specified.

2. No Check or Checkmate

The concepts of "Check" and "Checkmate" are disabled.

A player is allowed to move their King into a square where it can be attacked.

A player is not forced to move their King out of danger if it is currently under attack.

3. Win Condition

Capture the King: The game is won by physically capturing the opponent's King.

The game ends immediately when the King is removed from the board.

Game Modes

Standard Mode

Classic Setup: The board is initialized with the traditional Chess layout.

White pieces occupy rows 1 and 2.

Black pieces occupy rows 7 and 8.

Rooks on corners, followed by Knights, Bishops, and the King/Queen in the center.

Random Mode

Chaos Setup: The back-rank pieces (Rooks, Knights, Bishops, Queen) are placed in randomized positions.

King Stability: The King remains in its standard starting position (E1 for White, E8 for Black) to ensure the game starts fairly.

Pawns remain in their standard rows (Rows 2 and 7).
