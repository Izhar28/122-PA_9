Overview

It's basically chess, but with a simplified ending and a fun random mode.

The Rules

1. Moving Pieces

All pieces move exactly like they do in Standard Chess.

Special moves like Castling and En Passant still work the same way.

2. No "Check" or "Checkmate"

We disabled the concepts of Check and Checkmate.

If your King is in danger, you aren't forced to move it—you can play other pieces instead.

3. How to Win

Capture the King: The game ends the moment you physically capture the opponent's King.

Just take the King off the board to win.

Game Modes

Standard Mode

Classic Setup: The board looks just like a normal chess game.

White pieces are at the bottom, Black pieces are at the top.

Everything is where you expect it to be.

Random Mode

Randomized Back Row: The heavy hitters (Rooks, Knights, Bishops, Queen) are shuffled into random spots on the back row.

King Stays Put: To keep things fair, the King always starts in its normal spot (E1 for White, E8 for Black).

Pawns: Pawns stay in their normal rows.
